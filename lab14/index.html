  	<h1>Lab 14: Debugging Tools & StrategieS</h1>
  		<h2>Challenge</h2>
    		<p>The challenge posed by lab 14 was to debug and fix past labs.</p>

  		<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn't encounter any problems with this lab.</p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained from this lab were successful. I was able to
				restyle older labs so that they were more aesthetically coherent with my current labs, mainly adding the changing background colors.</p>

			<h2>Debbugging</h2>
				<p>For this lab, I didn't debug any particular labs but I took the time to improve my styling
					on older labs, particularly 2-4, making them more aestheatically coherent. I also took the time
					to put together some lab documents that I hadn't made yet.
