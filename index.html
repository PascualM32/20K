		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hello everyone! My name is Pascual Martinez and I am a freshman studying
			art and electronic music at UCSC. I mainly make digital art but I love to
			work with whatever I can get my hands on. I especially like drawing,
			producing music, spinning records, and making experimental videos. 
			I grew up in Guadalajara, Jalisco and was born there in 2003. After living
			there for 6 years, my family moved to San Francisco, where I spent the
			rest of childhood. When moving to the United States, the culture shock was
			incredibly formative for me. To this day, the duality of cultures that
			I have experienced is one of my main inspirations. Furthermore, my home
			country also serves as one of my main inspirations, as I try to bring
			aspects of my culture and home to life in my art. At UCSC, I hope to
			continue growing as a learner, developing new skills to further aid me
			in my learning career.</p>
