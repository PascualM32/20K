		<h1>Subject of Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<P>The goal of this lab was to help us better understand local file structures
				and their functions. I accomplished this by continuing to format my own
				local file structure, adding new index.html files and images. Another aim
				of lab 3 was to help us become more efficient and diligent when uploading
				our work to public servers.</p>
		<h1>Challenges</h1>
			<p>Some of the main challenges that I encountered while working on lab
				3 revolved around the use of images in code. I struggled to link my images
				to the html file for lab 3, but once I successfully did it twice, the rest
				of the images were easy to link. I also struggled a bit with structure because
				I had misundertsood the roles of headings and their corresponding numbers.
				This lead to some occasions in which I questioned why heading sizes were differing.
				Nonetheless, this lab went rather smoothly, and all other structural and organizational
				tasks went smoothly as well.</p>
		<h1>Results of Lab 3</h1>
				<p> The results of this lab are shown below, where you can see that I
				further created my local file structure by the new files seen within the
				new file structure. Furthermore, you can see that the screenshots below
				show how I changed my file structure to be as it is now. For example,
				by adding index.html files to both the main art101 folder and the lab3 folder.
				Now, I have two new index.html pages, one main, homepage and a page explaining
				lab 3 and my results for the lab.</p>
