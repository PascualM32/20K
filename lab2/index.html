		<h2>Vincent Wenzler</h2>

		<p> I am a second year Art major at UCSC.
			I have worked with various physical and digital tools, programs and mediums.
			My favorite medium probably is using clay, or other scupltural mediums.
			Other than doing Art, I like building model kits, listening to music and playing videogames.
			I live in Oakland California primarily, and have spent a lot of my time swimming or playing water polo.
			Currently though I am focused on my art, and am living in Santa Cruz working on how to improve.<p>

			<h2>Pascual Martinez</h2>

			<p>Hello everyone! My name is Pascual Martinez and I am a freshman studying
				art and electronic music at UCSC. I mainly make digital art but I love to
				work with whatever I can get my hands on. I especially like drawing,
				producing music, spinning records, and making experimental videos. 
				I grew up in Guadalajara, Jalisco and was born there in 2003. After living
				there for 6 years, my family moved to San Francisco, where I spent the
				rest of childhood. When moving to the United States, the culture shock was
				incredibly formative for me. To this day, the duality of cultures that
				I have experienced is one of my main inspirations. Furthermore, my home
				country also serves as one of my main inspirations, as I try to bring
				aspects of my culture and home to life in my art. At UCSC, I hope to
				continue growing as a learner, developing new skills to further aid me
				in my learning career.</p>
