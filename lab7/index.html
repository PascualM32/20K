				<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<P>The challenge posed by this lab was to work with functions in Javascript, in order
				to gain a better understanding of how they work and the roles that they serve. </p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main problem that I encountered in this lab was with my background for the page and
					with getting the outputted .js script to fit within the text bubble of the character
					that I drew. I did some research online and was able to figure out how to style the
					outputted script so that it would fall in the text box. Other than that, we were both able
					to complete the lab without many issues and were able to create webpages to present our work for lab 7.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab are shown below. I was able to create
				a .html, .css, and .js page for lab 7, having them all succesfully linked. I was therefore
				able to create a webpage that presented my work for lab 7. I was able to code a .js function
				that asks the webpage's user for their name and then rearranges its letters, printing
				the rearranged name to the speech bubble of the "NAME TELLER" that I drew for the lab. All in all,
				this lab was very succesfull and I was able to get it all done succesfully.</p>
