  	<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
  		<h2>Challenge</h2>
    		<p>The challenge posed by lab 13 was to create a loop function in Javascript that
					looped through numbers 1 to 200 as inputs and would output the words Fizz, Buzz, and
					Boom, separately or in a mix depending on the attributes of the number.
					For example, multiples of 3 outputted ‘fizz!’, multiples of 5 outputted ‘buzz!’,
					and if a number was a multiple of both for example, it would output ‘fizzbuzz!’ </p>

  		<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I encountered few problems with this lab because I felt as if I had a
					solid understanding of the concept at hand, javascript loops. I only encountered some
					syntax errors in my javascript code which I was able to debug easily by using the
					console in chrome when viewing my file locally. Other than that, I also had to review my notes
					from the lecture on loops and some of my notes from previous lectures to refresh my memory a bit. </p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained from this lab were successful. As you can see, I was able to get the basic function of the lab to work but was also able to complete the bonus task for the lab, printing my results neatly in a table and adding an additional factor to the function. Additionally, I also was able to change the max number we loop through and add form fields that allow you to change the factors we are looking for and the text that gets outputted. You can see these results on the uploaded webpage which is linked on the title page of the lab. </p>
