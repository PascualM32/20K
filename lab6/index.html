				<img id="transportationpic" src="img/transportation.jpg" style="width:150px;"/>
				<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JavaScript arrays and objects.</p>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<P>The challenge posed by this lab was to experiment with
				objects and arrays in Javascript. We were tasked with creating a
				.js file that listed all of our main forms of transportation as well as
				our single, main form of transportation, as in lab 5. We were also tasked
				with creating an .html file, styled with .css, to present our work for lab 5.
				We linked the .js file for lab 6 to the .html file of the lab in order to
				present the output of the Javascript code.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main problem that I encountered in this lab was with the styling
				of the webpage for the lab. I struggled a bit to center my text boxes, but
				after doing some research, I was able to get the right styling. Other than that,
				the lab went smoothly for my partner and I and we were able to get it done
				successfully. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab are shown below. I was able
				to gain a better understanding of the role of objects and arrays in Javascript.
				I was also able to create all three, .js, .ccs, and .html files for my lab,
			 	and linked them to present my work for lab 6. This lab went smoothly for
				my partner and I, and we were able to get it done with few issues. </p>
