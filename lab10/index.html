				<p>Working with your partner, experiment with JS events.</p>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<P>The challenge posed by this lab was to experiment with JavaScript events.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn’t encounter any specific problems with this lab, but it took me a little bit
					of time to figure out the instructions of the lab. Nonetheless, by talking
					with my partner I was able to get a better understanding quickly. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I was able to obtain successful results for this lab. As you can see,
					when you input your name into the textbox and hit the ‘click’ button, a
					new page will appear with the printed text of your name in alphabetical order.</p>
