				<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<P>The challenge posed by this lab was to experiment with DOM manipulation
				in Javascript. By practicing with DOM manipulation, we learned how to manipulate
				aspects of our index.html and .css files from within Javascript. This is useful for
				creating changes in the styling and structure of our webpage from within Javascript.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main problem that I encountered in this lab was with understanding the lab conceptually.
				I wasn't too sure about what we were exactly practicing when working with DOM manipulation.
				Nonetheless, I was able to realize that DOM manipulation allows us to change the appearance and structure
				of our webpage from within Javascriopt. This means that we can change index.html and .css elements straight from
			 	our Javascript code. Other than that, the actual coding for lab 9 went rather smoothly and I was able
				to get my code working quickly, with little troubleshooting. It just took me some time initially
				to figure out what exactly the instructions were asking. Nonetheless, I was able to figure out my issues
				with my partner and the problem solving went smoothly.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab are shown below. I was able use DOM manipulation
				in JavaScript to print the script of my "newEl" variables from JavaScript. Those variables
			 	say, "Hello, stranger!" and "Hello, hello!" I was also able to use DOM manipulation to
				change the .css styling of the outputted script.</p>
