		<h1>Lab 15: Ajax</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>The challenge posed by this lab was to create a webpage that had a
					button with a click event that was linked to a chosen API endpoint with
					jQuery AJAX and outputted the API’s data in a string. We were also, as always,
					 tasked with creating a .html file and .css file to go along with the javascript,
					 but since we have created these lab web pages several times by now, this part was
					 easy and went smoothly. The challenge at hand was a bit confusing initially, but my partner
					 and I were able to eventually figure it out. </p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn’t encounter too many problems with Lab 15, and although it was a
					bit confusing initially, once I figured out the instructions for the lab, I
					was able to get the lab done smoothly. I also had some syntax errors in my html
					and .js code, but I was able to identify and fix them relatively quickly by using the console in chrome. </p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab were successful, as you can see
					I chose the Kanye.rest API, which outputs and prints random Kanye quotes
					to my webpage when you click the “Kanye West” button. </p>
