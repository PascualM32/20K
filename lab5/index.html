		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types & Variables</h1>
			<img id="golfpic" src="img/golf2.jpg"/>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<P>The challenge posed by this lab was to experiment with and utilize different
					data types and variables from Javascript order to better understand them.
				 	By exploring the different data types and variables, we gained a better understanding
					of Javascript's role and function.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main problem that I encountered in this lab was with the .css page
				for the lab. I wanted to play with my styling more and decided to add animations
				to my page. I researched how to do so online and ended up coding an animation that switches the background colors of
				my two sections from the lab back and forth. I also struggled slightly to link my
				Javascript code to my .html page for Lab 5, but after some trial and error with the naming of my file,
				I was able to link it easily. Other than those two problems, the rest of the lab went smoothly,
				since both, my partner and I, encountered very few problems when working on the lab.
				Those that we  did encounter, we solved relatively quickly. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab are shown below. As you can see,
				I was able to successfully work with variables in Javascript by defining them.
			 	I was also able to work with different data types, as Javascript will accept numbers,
				years, true/false, yes/no, etc... I was also able to create a functional .js
				file for Lab 5 and I was able to link it to my .html file, where my .js file
				output its script successfully. The creation of the .html page was also relatively
				fast and I was able to get it done without problems. </p>
