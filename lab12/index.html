			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge posed by lab 12 was to code a conditional Javascript function
					that would give the user a certain assigned output based on the amount of letters in their name, which they input.
					We were also tasked with presenting this function on a webpage made with html and styled with css.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problem">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I didn’t encounter any significant problems with the lab. I was able to get a good grasp
					of the class lecture in which we discussed Javascript conditional functions, and
					therefore, I was able to finish the lab with few problems. I did however, have several syntax errors which I found
					when troubleshooting, but they were all easy fixes and I got my page published and working quickly. </p>
			</div>

		<div id="results">
			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>My results for the lab were successful, as you can see, I chose to code
					a function that assigned the user to a soccer team, being either FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Arsenal, or SL Benfica.
					I did this by coding a button and event listener that would output one of these results based on the number of letters in the user’s name.
					As you can see, the webpage will assign you to a team based on your inputted name.</p>
