		<h1 id="ht">Lab 8: Anonymous Functions and Callbacks</h1>
				<p>Working with your partner experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<P>The challenge posed by this lab was to experiment with anonymouse functions and callbacks
				in Javascrpit, to gain an understanding on how they work and how they are utilized in coding.
				The lab also tasked us with creating an index.html page, syled with .css to present our work
				for lab 8.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The main problem that I encountered in this lab was when trying to complete the bonus task. I wasn't able
				to figure them out but I intend to keep trying. I also had a bit of trouble with my results and defining them
			 	in Javascript. I found that it was a small typing error, so I was able to fix the problem quickly. Other
				than that, the lab went smoothly for my partner and I, as we were able to succesfully complete it
				with few problems. </p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab are shown in the console section of the webpage. I wasn't
				able to print them, so one must inspect the lab document in order to see my results in the .js console.
				I was able to effectively code an anonymous function in .js that halved an array of integers
			 	and I was also able to code a callback function that returned the results of the halving function.</p>
