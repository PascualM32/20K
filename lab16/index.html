		      <h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs </h1>

		      <h2>Challenge</h2>
		      <p>For lab 16, we were tasked with the challenge to process JSON from an API, eventually
            creating a web page that outputs XKCD comics from the API. We also had to read through the
            XKCD API docs and then test the endpoint in our browsers. We were also tasked with creating
            a Javascript file, using AJAX to retrieve our data, storing it in a variable named comicObj.
            We then had to process our parts within our callback function, adding them to our webpage with the
            appropriate tags.</p>

		      <h2>Problems</h2>
		       <p>Conceptually, Lab 16 took me some time to wrap my head around and I
             struggled a bit with figuring out the code, having some syntax errors and
              some errors with calling the API. Nonetheless, I was able to debug and
              fix it using my console, by looking over the past lecture, and by spending a good amount
              of time thoroughly going through my notes to see what was going on in my code. This lab was a bit hard for me,
              it took me a lot of time to complete. Nonetheless, I was able to get the lab working after taking my sweet time
              with it!</p>

		      <h2>Results</h2>
		      <p>I was able to attain successful results for this lab. As you can see, clicking
          the button will print a comic from the XKCD comic API onto the webpage. I found this lab a bit frustrating and
          therefore, did not complete the bonus task, but I was excited by the possibilities of using JSON, AJAX, and
          APIs all in combination within JavaScript. It seems like there are a lot of possibilities when using the three altogether,
          but I am not exactly sure how I would use them for more creative/artistic projects like playing with visuals from APIs and such.</p>
