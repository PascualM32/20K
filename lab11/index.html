			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>I didn't encounter any specific challenges with lab 11. For lab 11,the challenge
					was to work with the jQuery library in JavaScript, using it to create a button event that would change
					the color of the different sections in our labs.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problem" class="sectionbox">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>When conducting this lab, I didn't encounter any particular problems, other than having to spend some extra time
					working on it and debugging it considering that my partner had an emergency and was not able to work on it with me. I also
					had a couple of syntax errors in my JavaScript code but I was able to fix them relatively quickly using the console in chrome.</p>
			</div>

		<div id="results" class="sectionbox">
			<h2>Reults</h2>
				<p>The results that I obtained for this lab were successful, as you can see, the different sections of the lab toggle
					between white and orange backgrounds when you click their correspondent buttons.</p>
